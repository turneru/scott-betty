								<h1 class="mobile">Our Story</h1>
								<h2>Timeline of a Romance</h2>
								<section class="timeline">
								  <ul>
									<li>
									  <div>
										<time>February 1971</time> <p>Scott and Betty met as freshmen at Western Illinois University (WIU) on a blind date on February 19, 1971, arranged by Betty's roommate, Peggy Turnipseed (Scott's HS classmate). The next night, Feb. 20th, Betty already had a date and wanted to cancel – but couldn't contact the guy, yes before cell phones existed. LOL</p>
										<p>However, when a friend, Bill Arle, walked members from Betty's dorm floor, she asked Bill to have Scott call her again. Little did Betty know that the night before, right after that blind date, Scott had told his friends, "That's the girl I'm going to marry!" They had a second date on Feb. 21st and their life together was underway...</p>
									  </div>
									</li>
									<li>
									  <div>
										<time>March 1971</time> <p>On March 5th Scott asked Betty to go steady (she wore his Hersey H.S. ring). Then March 20, 1971, Betty received a Lavalier from Scott (the non-Frat version of being pinned). The 6th floor of girls met in the dorm study lounge and their resident advisor announced that one of the girls on the floor was just lavaliered – BETTY.</p>
									  </div>
									</li>
									<li>
									  <div>
										<time>December 1971</time> <p>On December 23, 1971, Scott proposed while visiting Betty's family for Christmas in Wyanet, IL. He was quite the jokester, hiding the ring inside a pool stick bag. The two played pool and snooker in the WIU Union, where Scott worked.</p>
									  </div>
									</li>
									<li>
									  <div>
										<time>January 1972</time> <p>Scott's "draft number" was low (young people will have to Google that) and his "no declared major" college interest was lower, so he opted for an Army enlistment, interrupting his sophomore year at WIU. Before leaving for Basic Training, Scott purchased a bright orange Opal GT sports car, which he left for Betty to use at college while he was in the Army. Of course, he had to teach her to drive a stick and didn't know about Betty's reverse-gear prowess – or lack thereof. (That's probably a full-glass-of-wine story for Betty to tell.)</p>
									  </div>
									</li>
									<li>
									  <div>
										<time>Basic Training 1972</time> <p>Scott traveled to Fort Polk, LA, for Basic Training. It's a place known to many as "the armpit of the nation," and to Army basic trainees by a somewhat lower anatomical reference. (The "moving floor" is a minimum two-beer story.)</p>
										<p>He left his Opal GT with Betty. (There's another two-beer story about Scott's friend Jeff borrowing the car.) During Betty's second year of college, she enjoyed the role of floor Resident Advisor. Then her Junior year, she was named the Assistant Head Resident of Grote Hall. But Grote closed. Betty was reassigned to Washington Hall, where she shared the duties with another Assistant.</p>
									  </div>
									</li>
									<li>
									  <div>
										<time>June 1973</time> <p>Scott and Betty married on Saturday, June 30, 1973. Betty's Mom designed her dress and the six bridesmaids' dresses along with the Jr. bridesmaid's dress. (You'll want to have one of them tell the story of the tardy groomsman, and the lector following the priest's specific instructions. BYOB.)</p>
										<p>After a brief honeymoon, Scott and Betty headed to Ft. Hood, TX, near the cotton-growing town of Copperas Cove. They lived in a little "shack house" in Copperas Cove. Betty commuted to college in Austin, TX, in the Opel GT, 75 miles away, and Scott rode his motorcycle to base.</p>
									  </div>
									</li>
									<li>
									  <div>
										<time>March - August 1974</time> <p>Scott was assigned, temporarily, to Chicago suburbs (near his old high school) as an Army recruiter-assistant. Betty was student teaching in Austin, TX when she learned she was going to have a baby. Christopher Scott Ehret was born on August 28, 1974.</p>
										  <p>Betty graduated from the University of Texas (Austin) in May 1974, but chose not to participate in the graduation ceremony. She was 6+ months pregnant and the summer heat had arrived in Texas, plus Scott was still TDY in Chicago.</p>
										  <p>Three days after the birth, the new family "hit the road," returning to WIU and Macomb, IL, where Scott would finish college as one of 50 Army scholarship winners.</p>
										  <p>Betty and Baby Christopher decided after only an hour that 1,300 miles in a U-Haul truck was a bad idea – even with an inflatable donut seat cushion. Scott drove them to DFW, the nearest airport, and the two first-time flyers soon landed in Chicago for a quickly scheduled visit with Grandma Dorothy and Aunt Debbie. (Ask Betty about her first flying experience – a "full wine bottle" story.) Before long the still-new family reassembled in Macomb at WIU. </p>
									  </div>
									</li>
									<li>
									  <div>
										<time>1974-1976</time> <p>Scott, Betty and Christopher lived in Macomb, first in married student housing (two different apartments) and then just off campus in a townhome in River Run. Scott graduated in May 1976 and was commissioned a 2Lt. Yeah, Betty has stories about enlisted &amp; commissioned, just like on Army Wives. He first traveled to Fort Knox, KY for summer duty. (There's at least one beer in there.) Betty and Chris visited for a short vacation with Betty's parents, Dick and Elaine Olds. Meanwhile, Betty continued working as a Periodicals Clerk in the WIU campus library.</p>
										 <p> In the fall, Scott, Betty and Chris moved to the Army's Aberdeen Proving Grounds in Maryland for his Ordnance Officer Basic Course. That Christmas Aunt Debbie and Grandma Dorothy (Scott's sister and Mom) visited just as Scott's training ended.</p>
										  <p>In retrospect, "careful preparation" became a problem. On orders to transfer to Ft. Bliss, TX, Scott and Betty's HUGE tactical error occurred when the family was fully packed by mid-January – shortly BEFORE they were invited to President Jimmy Carter's inaugural ball. Well, all the "good clothes and dress uniforms" were already packed so they declined the presidential invitation! They "KNEW" they would have another chance. LOL</p>
									  </div>
									</li>
									<li>
									  <div>
										<time>1977-1980</time> <p>Scott, Betty and Chris moved to El Paso, TX. Scott was stationed at Fort Bliss. Then, in 1979, the three of them adopted three-year-old Michael. Now a family of four, they were assigned "quarters" in family housing on Scott Street. (Go figure.)</p>
										<p>On June 2, 1980, Scott resigned his commission from the Army. (About a four-beer story.) The Ehret family moved to Palomino Drive in northeast El Paso. Betty taught 3rd and 4th grade at Loretto Academy until the fall of 1981.</p>
										<p>Scott, then unemployed, seemed destined for Umpire School and an attempt to become a professional baseball umpire. Instead, in September 1980, he took a job as a news reporter at KTSM-AM-FM-TV in El Paso. With a "real job" in hand and a family to feed, umpire school was quickly dismissed – rarely to be thought of again.</p>
									  </div>
									</li>
									<li>
									  <div>
										<time>1981-1988</time> <p>Betty began teaching 5th grade in the Ysleta School District at Parkland Elementary School near their Palomino Street home. That's where she became Gifted Certified in Texas. She also became a West Texas Writing Project Consultant. In 1986, Betty was encouraged by her assistant principal to join Alpha Delta Kappa, a teacher sorority built on the principles of excellence in education, world understanding, and altruism.</p>
										<p>When Chris was in 2nd grade, he decided to no longer use his first name, choosing instead his middle name, Scott. He enjoyed seeing "Scott Ehret" on the TV screen credits after the evening news. Yes, it took some time for Mom &amp; Dad to start calling him Scott, but his friends were appropriately jealous of their "famous" classmate.</p>
										<p>Scott worked from 1980-1982 at KTSM (NBC), with shifts that included working weekends. Betty remembered a time when he was gone "all day" working on election coverage. That's the day their waterbed leaked. (Another two-wine-glass minimum.)</p>
										<p>Scott next spent two years as the Media Consultant for the El Paso Electric Company, and even visited Phoenix and the Palo Verde Nuclear Station. (Betty and the boys joined him one weekend – another story about small airplanes.) Then, from 1985-1988, Scott worked for KVIA-TV, the ABC affiliate, in El Paso.</p>
										<p>The El Paso years included Scott working seven years, part-time, for The Diablos, the AA baseball team in town, and as a high school baseball umpire, and basketball and football official. It also included stints for both Scott Jr. and Michael as Diablo batboys – and Scott Jr.'s own entry to radio broadcasting. (His stories might revolve more around good Scotch.)</p>
									  </div>
									</li>
									<li>
									  <div>
										<time>12th Anniversary - 1985</time> <p>Scott and Betty took their first cruise, summer 1985, while Grandma Dorothy babysat in Florida.</p>
										<p>Of course, you know of Scott's great voice. From 1981 to 1988 he was on the radio as the "color commentator" for UTEP Basketball, with one season of football and a smattering of minor league baseball broadcasting mixed in. (Ask about the color-man story – it's best after a few other beer stories.)</p>
										<p>Then a funny thing happened... Scott and Betty realized the importance of being near family – when the junior high school boys couldn't tell which grandparents called on the phone. So, time to move again – this time back to the Midwest.</p>
									  </div>
									</li>
									<li>
									  <div>
										<time>1988-2000</time> <p>Scott became an assistant editor at Referee Magazine in Racine, WI (that umpiring and officiating passion, plus radio and television work, blended nicely into magazine journalism) while Betty and the boys finished the school year and sold the family's El Paso home. Scott shared an apartment with another new hire at Referee Magazine, Jeff Wilson. Scott said purchasing the family's Wisconsin home – ALONE! – was the scariest decision he'd ever made. When school ended, the Ehret family moved into the small, two-bedroom apartment while waiting to close on the new home in Sturtevant, WI.</p>
										<p>Scott continued officiating all three sports, but soon gave up basketball. He even officiated gymnastics with Betty for a few years. Through his writing, he met many influential sports officials in America and Canada. (Lots of stories to share – might not be enough beer in any refrigerator!)</p>
										<p>Betty began her Racine career as a sixth-grade teacher in the Racine School District. She received her Master's degree from Carthage College in 1993. Since Betty did not walk in her Undergraduate ceremony, she decided to participate in her Master's Degree Ceremony at Carthage College. Then on weekends, week nights, and during the summer, Betty taught courses for Carthage College, UW-Parkside, and McPherson College. She continued her work with Alpha Delta Kappa, joining Wisconsin's Tau chapter. Her last year in Racine, she taught 2nd grade at Giese Elementary. (A "pick your beverage" story about her first week on campus.)</p>
										<p>She became an author, writing a Science and Cooperative Learning resource book for teachers. (Is <em>anyone</em> still thirsty?)</p>
										<p>Meanwhile, Scott spent spring seasons umpiring Division I college baseball, and each fall officiating high school and Division III college football.</p>
									  </div>
									</li>
									<li>
									  <div>
										<time>1998</time> <p>Scott and Betty celebrated their 25th wedding anniversary with a ceremony at their local Catholic Church, and then partied at their home in Sturtevant with family and friends. (Granddaughter Audrina, age 2, wore a dress Great Grandma Olds made from the bridesmaid's material from Betty's wedding.)</p>
										<p>Both Mike and Scott Jr. tried sports, briefly. Scott Jr's basketball career ended during a Thanksgiving break practice when he broke his collarbone. One advantage, the principal gave him an elevator key so he wouldn't get bumped taking the stairs.</p>
									  </div>
									</li>
									<li>
									  <div>
										<time>1997-2003</time> <p>Scott became a partner in Gerry Davis Sports (GDS), an officials uniform &amp; equipment supplier based in Appleton, WI. With both boys graduated from high school and on their own, in 2000 Scott and Betty sold their home in Sturtevant and moved into an apartment in Appleton. Betty easily decided to search for a teaching job versus weekend commuting. She joined St. Joseph Middle School as a sixth-grade teacher and thoroughly enjoyed the work, but soon found allergies, asthma and breathing a major issue.</p>
										<p>In early summer 2003, Betty took a teaching job in Phoenix, AZ to test her breathing in a desert climate. She lived with her sister, Jan and Wayne Karp, in Sun Lakes and commuted to Pena Elementary, as a Gifted and Talented Teacher.</p>
									  </div>
									</li> 
									<li>
									  <div>
										<time>2004 - 2013</time> <p>Scott, still in Wisconsin, spent a year preparing to run the GDS operation from afar – yeah, today "working remotely" is no big deal … it was in 2004 – then left Appleton and drove a U-Haul to Arizona. Betty played the solo buyer this time, and put down earnest money on three different homes – each with the contingency of Scott's approval. The decided on a new-build, but the builder had setbacks, and soon Betty found their "forever" home in an active adult community, Pebble Creek, in Goodyear. </p>
										<p>In 2006, Scott Jr. and Catherine were married in Liberty, South Carolina, in the home of Cat's parents, Fred and Paula Connington. Bride &amp; Groom each invited parents, grandparents and one special guest to a small, intimate, truly wonderful ceremony. The newlyweds took time from their honeymoon to visit Grandma Dorothy just before Dorothy joined Grandpa Bob in Heaven (Scott Sr's parents).</p>
										<p>Betty loved her Gifted and Talented teaching position in Phoenix, and her partner teachers. But in 2011, the school district decided to suspend the self-contained gifted program due to busing costs. Betty's team members scattered, and Betty became a Reading Intervention Specialist at Heatherbrae Elementary.</p>
										<p>In 2010 GDS began struggling and Gerry Davis, the majority owner, began maneuvering to sever Scott's partnership. After years of wrangling, it dissolved in 2019. (Don't bring beer into this story unless you want to tap a keg.)</p>
										<p>The "better" part of the 2012 chapter is Scott's foray into real estate. He attended school and earned a real estate license in late 2012. More on that is coming up.</p>
									  </div>
									</li> 
									<li>
									  <div>
										<time>2013-2018</time> <p>Betty enjoyed working with the reading intervention students, but longed for the Gifted and Talented connections. She interviewed for a job as "Instructional Coach for the Gifted" with the Laveen Elementary School District, and the night after her interview, the HR Director called and offered her the position. For five years she travelled between three schools and had 150-210 students on her caseload, but LOVED every minute of teaching enrichment.</p>
										<p>During her teaching career, cognizant of dwindling money supplies and school budgets, Betty began writing grant applications. Over the course of her career, Betty's applications were awarded close to $50,000 for classroom supplies, computers, field trips and children's books.</p>
										<p>On June 1, 2018, after 41-years in many classrooms, it was time. Betty's teaching retirement became official. However, she continued her Alpha Delta Kappa involvement and became the State President-Elect in 2016, a six-year commitment.</p>
										<p>Scott earned his real estate license in 2012, and within a year joined The Fry Team, an agent group led by DeAnn Fry. At DeAnn's suggestion, Scott focused most of his attention on managing residential rental properties. In 2022, Scott became a Certified Residential Property Manager. Right now, he manages approximately 20-25 homes in the Phoenix area. In 2018, upon Betty's retirement, she became his administrative assistant, and plans to retire from that position in early 2023.</p>
									  </div>
									</li>	
									<li>
									  <div>
										<time>2018-2021</time> <p>Life changed for the Ehret family when COVID hit America. Betty's compromised immune system – remember those Wisconsin breathing problems? – took precedence in daily life. Scott became the purchaser of grocery items and runner of errands, while Betty tackled Amazon and online shopping.</p>
										<p>In 2020 the Olds family lost both of Betty's parents, Dick and Elaine Olds. With COVID restrictions, a ceremony for Dad (Dick) was held on August 22, 2020 and then on August 6th, 2021, was Mom's (Elaine's) long-delayed funeral and the combined burial ceremony. They each chose cremation.</p>
										<p>The 2020s brought some of the best news in a long time! Granddaughter Audrina Ehret-Tjader married Tim Taylor on February 27, 2021, and Papa Scott Ehret attended, using his I-Pad to film the wedding so Grandma Betty (at home) could watch on Zoom, along with members from both families. Michael (Audrina's dad) was there and danced the Father-Daughter Dance.</p>

										<p>Continuing the happy. On January 5, 2022, Tim &amp; Audrina gave birth to Leo William Taylor. He is Scott &amp; Betty's Great Grandson. He may be the happiest baby ever! Leo has a big smile for everyone he meets!</p>
										<p>At the April 2022 Alpha Delta Kappa Arizona Convention, Betty presented a speech regarding her term of office and COVID, with a hint of Phyllis Diller! She happily met her mentee, Jill Judah, an ADK Collegiate Club officer at the Convention. </p>
										<p>In June 2022 the Olds family members gathered in Chicago for Emily Sokalski's (Betty's Goddaughter's) wedding to Turner Uligian – with Scott Jr. officiating the wedding! Of course, there was a pre-wedding visit with Leo and his parents in nearby Wisconsin. Audrina &amp; Tim even joined the wedding gang on Sunday to "show-off" Leo and see family – most for the first time in years.</p>
										<p>Betty and Scott drove the wedding trip, stopping on the way home in Pawhuska, OK. (More stories to share, maybe tomorrow?) When Scott and Betty arrived home, their new TESLA Model Y was parked in their garage!</p>
										<p>Scott's first road trip with the TESLA happened in early August. He traveled to northern California to umpire the American Legion West Regional Baseball Tournament (his 13th regional assignment).</p>
										<p>At the end of September, Scott &amp; Betty – knowing the Tesla needed exercise – traveled back to Chicago for Scott's 50th high school class reunion, a few years late due to COVID. Scott reconnected with scores of classmates. Then, surprise!, another visit with Leo and Audrina and Tim! Great times with such a happy baby and family!</p>

										<time>The Big 50</time> <p>Now, Betty and Scott are planning an EPIC Adventure in summer 2023 to celebrate their 50th wedding anniversary. It will be a May-June-July driving trip around and across the USA, designed to reconnect with friends &amp; family, and see America from coast to coast. If you'd like to be on the destination list for a beverage, a meal, or a visit, be sure to let them know!</p>
